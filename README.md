How does TypeScript improve code maintainability and scalability?

Scaling and maintaining code can be difficult for software development. Maintaining an organised, comprehensible, and scalable codebase becomes very important when developers collaborate on projects with several team members.

How TypeScript enhances code maintainability and scalability with Static Typing?

TypeScript provide powerful solution to improve code maintainability and scalability through static typing.

What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. As well as it is the superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, llowing developers to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.


Benefits of Static Typing:
  .Type Safety:Developers can avoid type-related mistakes at runtime by defining the data types of variables, arguments,  and return values using static typing.

  Example: TypeScript catches type mismatches during development.
        function greet(name: string): string {
           return `Hello, ${name}!`;
          }

        greet("Alice");       // ✅ OK
        greet(123);           // ❌ Error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
